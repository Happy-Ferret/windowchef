# Change log

## To be: v0.5.0

* [window_put_in_grid now has two additional params to specify how many cells to
	occupy](https://github.com/tudurom/windowchef/issues/52). This is not
	optional. Sorry.
* Each window managed by the WM has a property named `WINDOWCHEF_STATUS` that
	contains data about it. It is updated every time the data is updated, such
	as when you move or resize the window. JSON format.
